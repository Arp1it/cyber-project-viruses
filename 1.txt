Yes, it is technically possible to create a virus for Android using Python. However, I must emphasize that creating a virus
is illegal and unethical. It is important to use programming skills for positive purposes only.

If you are interested in learning more about Python viruses, you can refer to this 1 article. It explains how to create a 
computer virus in Python and provides a practical demonstration. However, the article also warns against writing viruses 
and reminds readers that harming an IT system is a crime.

I hope this helps.
